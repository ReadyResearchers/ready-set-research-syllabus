# CMPSC 610: Spring Semester of Two-Semester Senior Thesis Research

## Introduction

Your senior thesis process affords you the opportunity to pursue independent
research in computer science.
This course parallels the kinds of intense inquiry and research inherent to both
academic life and a career as a computer scientist, data scientist, or software
engineer.
To that end, you will work closely with your readers to explore rich,
ever-complex, projects.
Though the faculty cannot promise that this work will be frustration- or
challenge-free, we invite you to pursue it with great enthusiasm, vigor, and to
-- above all -- find joy in the process.

### Grading policies

This course is graded according to the covenants of the [course contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please refer to this document to review course evaluation specifics. However, this section summarizes basic responsibilities and deliverables. For the purposes of evaluation, this course is separated into both "primary" and "secondary" assignments.

|Assignment                      |Primary/secondary requirement           |
|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
|Status updates                  |Secondary                               |

|Thesis chapters (drafts)        |Primary                                 |

To pass `CMPSC 610`, submissions of and participation in all primary requirements is mandatory. As demonstrated by the table above, these are:

* Thesis proposal
* Thesis proposal defense
* Thesis chapters

**Failure to successfully complete any of the above requirements will constitute a failing grade in the course.**

#### Class participation

As written,  you are required to attend scheduled meetings, providing meaningful
work toward course requirements.
For additional meetings with First or Second Reader(s), [make an appointment via
reader office hours](#Readers).

#### Course repositories

You are responsible for accepting and maintaining GitHub repositories for each
of the assigned course projects.
Repositories include completion- and submission-specific instructions via
`README` files.
Many of these operations feature using GitHub's tagging mechanism to release
PDFs of your proposal with versions that adhere to the course's semantic
versioning standard.

**Course instructors will only grade and provide feedback on projects that are
stored and properly released through GitHub.**

##### Status updates and peer review

This assignment types asks you to detail the progress made on identifying a
topic for your project and completing the preliminary research needed to
demonstrate its feasibility.
This work should account for feedback solicited from your First and Second
Readers.

In addition, you will be requested (at three points throughout the semester) to
complete peer reviews of draft documents.
This feedback is crucial to you and your peers' progress in this course.

##### Thesis proposal

The thesis proposal process is characterized by two fundamental parts.

###### Proposal document

Subject to multiple rounds of extensive revision, this technical document must
be formatted according to the Departments thesis proposal style requirements and
approved for a subsequent defense by your First Reader.

Basic features of the proposal document are listed in the [course
guidelines](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#proposal-document).

###### Proposal defenses

An oral defense of your proposal documentation to be held at a faculty-scheduled time. The first reader reserves the right to cancel students proposal defense if the thesis proposal document does not meet minimum requirements outlined in [course guidelines](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#proposal-defenses). Projects subject to this condition may require a follow-up defense.

##### Thesis chapters

A submission of any two draft chapters of your thesis document. Written in a professional and scientific style, these chapters must be formatted in the Department's thesis style. _Note that this style is different from the proposal style; guidelines for this style will be provided along with the thesis chapter assignment issued this semester_.

### A note on Internal Review Board (IRB) proposals

Should a project require IRB approval for use of human subjects research, students are responsible for having a first draft of the IRB proposal application completed by `1 November 2021`. Students should submit this proposal draft to their First Reader by this date.

### Syllabus revision policy

The faculty of the Department of Computer Science reserve the right to make changes to this syllabus document. Should a change occur, changes may be discussed with the members of the course community. Minor revisions to wording that do not impact course events or deliverables may be made without notice.

Any change which impacts dates or significant changes in student responsibility will be communicated -- in writing -- at least one week in advance of due date of the deliverable affected.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. The faculty encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from their First Readers. To meet with readers, consult [available office hours and make an appointment](#Readers).

Historically, students who are successful in department courses visit and discuss course procesess and assignments early and often.

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let us know immediately -- **full stop**.

Do not wait until the end of the semester.

Part of our role as course instructors is to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances of the on-going global pandemic. Again, let us remind and encourage you -- _**it is part of our job**_ to help you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

In many situations, the following list of resources may help:

* [The Maytum Learning Commons](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
* [Student Life](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentlife/)
