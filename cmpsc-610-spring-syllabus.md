# CMPSC 610: Spring Semester of Two-Semester Senior Thesis Research

## Introduction

Your senior thesis process affords you the opportunity to pursue independent
research in computer science.
This course parallels the kinds of intense inquiry and research inherent to both
academic life and a career as a computer scientist, data scientist, or software
engineer.
To that end, you will work closely with your readers to explore rich,
ever-complex, projects.
Though the faculty cannot promise that this work will be frustration- or
challenge-free, we invite you to pursue it with great enthusiasm, vigor, and to
-- above all -- find joy in the process.

## Course Description

Independent research in computer science.
Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this
course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab
sessions.
Must be taken on the letter-grade basis.

* Prerequisite: `CMPSC 580` and `CMPSC 600`
* Distribution Requirements: `None`

## Required Materials

### Course Textbooks

There are no required textbooks for this course.
However, the faculty _highly recommend_ investing in the following texts for
both academic and professional development:

|Title |Author |ISBN |
|:-----|:------|:----|
|_On Being a Scientist (3rd ed.)_ |National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine |978-0309119702 |
|_BUGS in Writing: A Guide to Debugging your Prose_ |Lyn Dupre |978-0201379211 |
|_Writing for Computer Science (3rd ed.)_|Justin Zobel|978-1852338022 |
|_Published_|Thomas Deetjen|ASIN: B085MQN3Q8 |

#### Platforms

* [ReadyResearchers Organization on GitHub](https://github.com/ReadyResearchers)
* [Ready, Set, Research! Discord Server](https://discord.gg/KBMAHZRH9x)

This course relies heavily on the above GitHub organization and Discord server.
Your work will be assigned and evaluated on and crucial communication
distributed through these two platforms.
You are expected to register for and remain active on these platforms throughout
the academic year.

##### Email policy

Despite the fact that the majority of our communication relies on [Ready, Set,
Research!
Discord Server](https://discord.gg/KBMAHZRH9x) other platforms, the faculty may
occasionally use email to communicate significant information.
As with other the other platforms used by this course, it is your responsibility
to be accountable for email communication.

#### Course repositories

You are responsible for accepting and maintaining GitHub repositories for each
of the assigned course projects.
Repositories include completion- and submission-specific instructions via
`README` files.
Many of these operations feature using GitHub's tagging mechanism to release
PDFs of your proposal with versions that adhere to the course's semantic
versioning standard.

**Course instructors will only grade and provide feedback on projects that are
stored and properly released through GitHub.**

##### Thesis chapters

A submission of any two draft chapters of your thesis document.
Written in a professional and scientific style, these chapters must be formatted
in the Department's thesis style.
_Note that this style is different from the proposal style; guidelines for this
style will be provided along with the thesis chapter assignment issued this
semester_.

### A note on Internal Review Board (IRB) proposals

Should a project require IRB approval for use of human subjects research,
students are responsible for having a first draft of the IRB proposal
application completed by `1 November 2021`.
Students should submit this proposal draft to their First Reader by this date.

## Course Policies

### Syllabus Revision

The faculty of the Department of Computer Science reserve the right to make
changes to this syllabus document.
Should a change occur, changes may be discussed with the members of the course
community.
Minor revisions to wording that do not impact course events or deliverables may
be made without notice.

Any change which impacts dates or significant changes in student responsibility
will be communicated -- in writing -- at least one week in advance of due date
of the deliverable affected.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code.
Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment.
Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of
Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course,
and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with
teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.
Such dialogue is encouraged.
However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who
discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who
produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone
else’s work.
It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the
Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student
submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the
provisions of the Honor Code.
Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were
derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the
department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the
general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the
_Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack
Overflow or text generation systems such as ChatGPT.

### Classroom Ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to
act according to discipline-specific ethics.
The faculty encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) [Code of
Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking Assistance

#### Course Assistance

Students who struggle to understand the knowledge and skills introduced in this course
are encouraged to seek assistance from their first and second readers.
To meet with your first and second readers, please visit their web site.
Historically, students who are successful in department courses visit and
discuss course processes and assignments early and often.

#### Outside Assistance

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to
participate in or complete course work, let us know immediately -- **full
stop**.

Do not wait until the end of the semester.

Part of our role as course instructors is to make sure that students receive the
assistance they need.
Do not hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do with respect to
your ability to handle your work.
This is especially true of our current circumstances of the on-going global
pandemic.
Again, let us remind and encourage you -- _**it is part of our job**_ to help
you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

In many situations, the following list of resources may help:

* [The Maytum Center for Student Success](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentsuccess/)
* [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/counseling/)
* [Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
* [Student Life](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentlife/)
* [Student Accessibility and Support Services](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/)

### Special Needs

Students with disabilities who need accommodations in this course are encouraged
to contact Disability Services at `+1 814-332-2898`.
Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons, located in Pelletier
Library.
Should you need accommodations, contact this office as soon as possible to
